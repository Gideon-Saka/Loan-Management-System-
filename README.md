# Loan Management System
# Project Overview
Financial institutions often manage loan applications and repayments using fragmented processes involving spreadsheets, emails, and manual verification. This leads to delays in approvals, lack of transparency for customers, difficulty tracking repayments, and limited managerial oversight. The goal of this project was to analyse and design a centralized Loan Management System that digitizes the full loan lifecycle — from application submission to loan closure.

# Business Problem
Customers experienced uncertainty about application status and payment schedules, while staff struggled with repetitive manual checks and inconsistent record keeping. Managers also lacked real-time visibility into loan performance and overdue accounts. These inefficiencies increased operational risk and reduced customer satisfaction.

# Proposed Solution
I analysed the current workflow and designed a system that structures the process into clear operational roles: Customer, Loan Officer, Credit Manager, and Finance Officer.
The solution enables:

- Online loan application submission and status tracking

- Structured validation and credit assessment

- Managerial approval workflow

- Automated disbursement instruction

- Repayment tracking and overdue monitoring

- Automatic loan closure and notification

# Key Analysis Activities

- Identified stakeholders and their responsibilities

- Modelled the business workflow using BPMN 2.0 collaboration diagram

- Defined functional and non-functional requirements

- Created detailed use cases for core business operations

- Designed a traceable lifecycle from application → approval → disbursement → repayment → closure

# Business Value Delivered
The proposed system improves operational efficiency, ensures auditability of financial decisions, increases transparency for customers, and provides real-time reporting for management. By digitizing the loan lifecycle, the organization can reduce processing time, minimize human error, and improve service reliability.
